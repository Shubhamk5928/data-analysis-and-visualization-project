Inspiration -
I was always curious about how institutes have performed over the year, which institutes got improved or which institutes got worsened, how many of them were able to retain their top position ? And the nirf ranking seemed to offer reliable and comprehensive data on institutes since 2016.

Description of Dataset :
Content
The dataset contains available Rankings and Different Scores of the Institutes over 2016 to 2021. The dataset contains folders for each year containing the scores of the institutes and ranking for that year. The files outside the folder contains the Combined data of institute from 2016 to 2021 which can help in analyzing the performance of the institutes over the years.

Parameters for Ranking :-
A) Teaching, Learning & Resources (TLR)
1.Faculty-Student Ratio with Emphasis on Permanent Faculty (FSR) 2.Combine Metric for Faculty with PhD and Experience (FQE) 3.Metric for Library and Laboratory Facilities (LL) 4.Metric for Sports and Extra-Curricular Facilities, Activities (SEC)

B) Research and Professional Practice (RP)
1.Combined Metric for Publications (PU) 2.Combined Metric for Citations (CI) 3.IPR and Patents: Granted, Filed, Licensed (IPR) 4.Percentage of Collaborative Publications and Patents (CP) 5.Footprints of Projects and Professional Practice (FPPP)

C) Graduation Outcome (GO)
1.Combined Performance in Public and University Examinations (PUE) 2.Combined Percentage for Placement, Higher Studies and Entrepreneurship (PHE) 3.Mean Salary for Employment (MS)

D) Outreach and Inclusivity (OI)
1.Outreach Footprint (Continuing Education, Service) (CES) 2.Percentage of Students from Other States/Countries(Region Diversity – RD) 3.Percentage of Women Students and Faculty (WS) 4.Percentage of Economically and Socially 5.Disadvantaged Students (ESDS)

E) Peer Perception (PR)
Process for Peer Rating in Category (PR)Scrutinizing by these two parameters itself, things don’t seem to be falling in a rigorous order. Interestingly, the parameter on perception at number (f) is somehow interspersed between those of Publication Details and IPR Summary. This is a significant departure from the established practice of rigorous data processing whereby the consistency of the framework has to be ensured by all means.
Note:-
Incidentally, Datasets for some of the parameters are missing altogether.


Final Outcomes of our Analysis :
From the analysis, it is observed that NIRF ranking has attracted more participation of institution of higher education from across india in all categories and subject domains.The number of particiapants has increased every year.It may also be noted that highest number of institutions are located in southern region of India.Major number of institute are in Tamil Nadu.And among these institutes most are in chennai.
